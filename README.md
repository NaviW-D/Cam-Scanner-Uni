# Cam-Scanner-Uni
# License Plate Recognition Camera
This project builds a camera that can automatically read and recognize license plates on cars.
### Overview
The camera uses computer vision and machine learning models to detect and read license plates in real-time video streams. Key features:
Uses OpenCV for computer vision techniques like image processing, object detection etc.
Employs a custom trained YOLO v5 model to detect license plates in video frames
Applies optical character recognition (OCR) to extract the license plate text
Can achieve 90%+ accuracy in ideal lighting conditions
## Getting Started
### Prerequisites
You need Python 3.6 or later and the following packages:
- OpenCV
- NumPy
- TensorFlow (for YOLOv5 model)
- easyOCR (for OCR)
 
 It's recommended to use a GPU for efficient performance.
### Usage
1. Clone the repo
1. Install dependencies
1. Download pre-trained YOLOv5 weights file (provided in repo/models dir)
1. Run python app.py with appropriate command line args
1. Point camera at cars to detect and recognize license plates!
### Custom Training
The pre-trained model works well but you can improve accuracy by re-training the YOLOv5 model on your own license plate datasets. The repo includes the scripts and annotations for re-training.
